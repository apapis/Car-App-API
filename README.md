# Car Listing App API - In Progress 

This project is the API for the Car Listing App, enabling the creation and management of car listings. It is built using .NET and serves as the backend for scraping data and interacting with the WordPress API.

Key Features:
- Scrapes car data from the Otomoto website (https://www.otomoto.pl/) and forwards it to the frontend application.
- Allows for adding car listings through the API.
- Integrates with the WordPress API, facilitating easy management of listings on an existing website.

This API is designed to ensure smooth and efficient communication with the Car Listing App's frontend, allowing for automatic form filling of listings based on data scraped from Otomoto.
